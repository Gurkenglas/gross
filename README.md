# Gross

This is a spoof on the [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) library
using the NCurses terminal rendering library. The idea of roguelike is to allow the
user to write a game which is more or less a state machine with respect to the outside
world, and then operate it move by move, allowing the user to move each time and drawing
it as such.
